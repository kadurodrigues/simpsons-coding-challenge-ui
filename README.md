# UI Coding Challenge

Create a basic web application using a SPA framework of your choice. Assume the API will be delivered later, but we have some sample JSON in the data folder which you can use for mocking out the API connections. We want the ability to search characters and to display their quotes.

**Definition of Done**

_We need to see this_

1. A complete SPA application that can be booted up and run locally on port 8080
1. Use of a mocking framework to simulate API operations
1. An example of all the possible CRUD routes that you would expect to find in the API
1. Use of a state store, such as REDUX, Vuex or NgRX
1. UI Unit tests

**What we're looking at**
1. A meaningful and logical UX which is clean and simple
1. A good understanding of how to manage state in a SPA application
1. Well formatted javascript code
1. Clean gitflow workflow so we can see your thought process
